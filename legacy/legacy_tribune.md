# Legacy tribune

A legacy [tribune](../tribune.md) is a /customary standard/. It has a least a [bouchot](../bouchot.md):

- an [XML backend](xml_backend.md) accessible through HTTP request.
- an HTTP POST support for posting messages.

Most alive tribunes add features:

- integrated coincoin
- TSV backend
- X-Post-ID
- new posts returned on POST request
- file upload
